## 🚀 Chrono Rift — Overview

Chrono Rift is a 2D action–survival game inspired by the Vampire Survivors genre. Players must survive against ever-growing waves of monsters, level up, customize builds, and face unique bosses. The game emphasizes simple controls, fast-paced dodging and positioning, and emergent build synergies.

Play as one of two main characters — Liam or Aria — each with distinct weapons and upgrade paths. Survive as long as possible, unlock stages and upgrades, and defeat the final boss to clear a stage.
